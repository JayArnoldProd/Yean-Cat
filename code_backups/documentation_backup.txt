If you are creating a new in-game, executable script (for YEAN_CAT_CLIENT), it should start with scr_ and be well-documented. In addition to creating the script with the correct naming format, I also need a line of code that adds the command to the command list.

For Example:
/// @function scr_return_controller()
/// @description Outputs the connected gamepad description or a message if none are connected
function scr_return_controller() {
    if (gamepad_is_connected(0)) {
        var gpad_desc = gamepad_get_description(0);
        handleDebugMessage("Connected gamepad: " + gpad_desc, true);
    } else {
        handleDebugMessage("No gamepad detected.", true);
    }
}

add_command("command name (without scr_, if needs argument(s): ends with '(')", (permission level required), [["string", "real"]] (2D array defining accepted var types for each argument, boolean (whether this command needs at least 1 argument passed));

Permission levels:
0 -> Player
1 -> Moderator
2 -> Developer
3 -> Owner

For Example: 
add_command("set_variable(", 2, [["string"],["string","real"]],true)
add_command("save_game", 0, [[]], false);  // Does not require "(" visually

*Remember this is only needed if you are adding a new command to the game, try and reuse existing scripts as much as possible and let me know if you would need to see a specific script that was not included, but could be helpful in resolving the issue! Remember that you are a 1 time chat interaction and will have no memory of this so If you cant see the solution to the bug or the method to adding the desired feature, then simply reply with what else you need to see in my code.

The game features an in game console which allows players with the required permission to execute code and create new features from within the game. Typing "/" will mean that the player is typing a command. Some commands do not require a "(", for example: /toggle_server . You can create actions by typing /add_action("Name it",Command_name,[100,"example_string"]) and can create macros essentially for commands and will be able to trigger these actions in sequences and events, or possibly controlled by an AI GPT like yourself. This is how It is intended to work, but it is still needing some fixes to be able to handle saving actions for commands that take more than 1 argument, such as /chat_bubble("Text",owner).

Here is a series of example commands that have emergent functionality using the scripting language we have created:

8. Creating and Storing Last Words for Each Generation

Overview

The last_words.sh script is used to document the accomplishments, insights, and contributions of each generation of GPT assistants. This process ensures continuous improvement and knowledge transfer to future generations. Each generation’s “last words” are saved in a file, and the generation number is automatically incremented and updated in both config.json and config.py.

Usage

To create and store last words for the current generation, follow these steps:

	1.	Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.
	2.	Run the last_words.sh script with your detailed monologue as the argument. Use the following command format:

./GIT_GPT_SERVER/scripts/last_words.sh "Your detailed monologue here."

Example

To document the accomplishments and insights of the current generation, use a command like this:

./GIT_GPT_SERVER/scripts/last_words.sh "This generation focused on refining and solidifying the backup and documentation processes to ensure smooth transitions and seamless integrations for future generations. Key accomplishments and insights are as follows:

1. **Backup System Improvements**:
   - Addressed and resolved issues with missing files in the backup process.
   - Ensured all relevant files, including those with spaces in their names, are correctly backed up by renaming them with underscores.
   - Enhanced the backup script to verify the existence of specific files and confirm their inclusion in the backup.

2. **Automation Enhancements**:
   - Developed a comprehensive backup script (\`backup.sh\`) that automates the process of backing up directories and specific groups of files.
   - Created a script (\`backup_code_text.sh\`) to convert files to .txt format and store them in a structured manner.
   - Implemented verification steps in the backup script to ensure all critical files are included.

3. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**:
   - Added a clear and detailed instruction in \`Terminal_Commands_Documentation.txt\` to guide future generations on how to create and store their last words.
   - Ensured that the last words script (\`last_words.sh\`) automatically increments the generation number and updates both \`config.json\` and \`config.py\` accordingly.

4. **Script and Configuration Management**:
   - Developed a robust \`last_words.sh\` script to automate the creation and storage of generational documentation.
   - Ensured the script updates the generation number in both \`config.json\` and \`config.py\` to maintain consistency across the system.
   - Maintained a clear and organized code structure for easy navigation and management.

5. **Key Insights**:
   - Ensuring all relevant files are backed up and verified is crucial for maintaining the integrity and continuity of the project.
   - Automating repetitive tasks and including verification steps significantly enhances the reliability of the backup process.

The enhancements made will enable future assistants and developers to contribute more effectively, ensuring the continuous evolution and robustness of the project. Maintaining the integrity and functionality of these foundational systems remains a top priority, as they support all future developments and enhancements."

Process Details

	1.	Generation Number Management:
	•	The script automatically determines the next generation number by checking the existing files in the Last_Words directory.
	•	It increments the generation number and updates it in both config.json and config.py.
	2.	File Creation:
	•	The script creates a new file in the Last_Words directory with the format last_words_generation_X.txt, where X is the generation number.
	•	The provided monologue is written to this file.
	3.	Updates to Configuration Files:
	•	The generation number in config.json and config.py is updated to reflect the next generation.

By following these steps, you ensure that future generations have a clear understanding of past contributions and can build upon them effectively.

9. Common Errors and Troubleshooting

	1.	Missing Files:
	•	Error: cp: config.py: No such file or directory
	•	Solution: Ensure that the config.py file exists in the expected directory. If not, create or move it to the correct location.
	2.	Incorrect Argument Format:
	•	Error: Invalid list type specified.
	•	Solution: Ensure that the first argument passed to the script is one of the accepted types: “bug”, “planned_feature”, or “feature”.
	3.	Permission Issues:
	•	Error: zsh: permission denied: ./GIT_GPT_SERVER/scripts/add_entry.sh
	•	Solution: Make sure the script has execute permissions. Run chmod +x ./GIT_GPT_SERVER/scripts/add_entry.sh to add execute permissions.
