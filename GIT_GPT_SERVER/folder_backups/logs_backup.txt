06/09/24 22:54:26: [Jay Arnold] Hello World!
06/09/24 22:54:37: [Jay Arnold] I will now demonstrate how the add action is not working
06/09/24 22:54:59: Action 'Lvl100' added successfully.
06/09/24 22:55:08: Executing action: level_up(100)
06/09/24 22:55:08: Level up initiated with goal: 100
06/09/24 22:55:18: [Jay Arnold] see? that works beautifully
06/09/24 22:55:22: Actions: Lvl100, 
06/09/24 22:55:37: [Jay Arnold] now what if i try /chat_bubble
06/09/24 22:55:50: Chat Bubble Created. Following 'yeancat' with text: 'Hello World!'
06/09/24 22:56:08: [Jay Arnold] the command works when executing normally, lets try and make it 
into an action
06/09/24 22:56:50: Action 'HelloWorld' added successfully.

06/09/24 22:59:08: [Jay Arnold] I will now end the test. but first heres a list of all my commands i can
 use so far. We just need to fix this bug involving the actions and then
 we can make many cool systems that use our action system.
