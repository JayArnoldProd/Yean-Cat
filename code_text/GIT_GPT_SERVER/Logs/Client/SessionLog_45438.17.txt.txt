05/25/24 23:10:50: [Jay Arnold] lets try with another controller and see if it works
05/25/24 23:10:58: [Jay Arnold] i think i know where my issues are coming from.
05/25/24 23:11:46: [Jay Arnold] i updated my mac os to the newest operating system and my 
gamemaker as well. I noticed that there have been 1 new version of the
 input extension since i last updated it, and theres even a beta for a 
next version available
05/25/24 23:12:28: [Jay Arnold] the xbox controller works ! it functions well, so that means theres 
something wrong with the playstation functionality and possibly switch
 controller aside from the xbox.

05/25/24 23:15:19: [Jay Arnold] some of the numbers are repeated. I believe the last ones were the 
horizontal and vertical movement of the joystick. and theres another 
value positive or negative that were not returning that indicates the 
direction. I think!
05/25/24 23:15:59: [Jay Arnold] i think its okay that we cant see this info. that was a good xbox test. ill
 try swaping to ps5 without restarting the game. my button icons 
should change. and we expect it to not function though.

05/25/24 23:19:42: Gamepad button pressed: 32782
05/25/24 23:20:04: [Jay Arnold] these buttons are not triggering the things they are supposed to but 
were working fine on xbox:

05/25/24 23:20:21: Gamepad button pressed: 32780
05/25/24 23:21:34: [Jay Arnold] 32780 is actually the only button that i could press that returned a 
value and was a button that wasnt functioning. the other buttons i 
pressed were not functioning and were not sending the message. the 
32780 is the square button and normally it enables banishment of 
choices in the levelup meu
05/25/24 23:21:38: [Jay Arnold] menu. 
05/25/24 23:22:46: [Jay Arnold] the triangle, circle, r1, and l1 buttons are doing anything at all. 
Perhaps updating input will solve this. my os update is the only 
explanation i can think of since you didnt (i think you didnt) modify any
 code that would have changed the functionality. 
05/25/24 23:22:50: [Jay Arnold] do you agree?
05/25/24 23:22:56: Saved Game
