We're getting closer, now I believe we just need to fix why the full action is not being saved for mainmenuchoices. I suspect that it has something to do with \n characters that are inserted into the command while typing it (for formatting the chat text input box). If these \n aren't being stripped before passing it as a command, it could perhaps be cutting off the creation of the action, thats my guess
