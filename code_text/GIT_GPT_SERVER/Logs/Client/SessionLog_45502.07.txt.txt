It crashed because I pressed enter, the presence of a dash (im not sure why it's being created) is the issue. I tried pasting /add_action_group(TpMenu,["GotoDivineDomain","SaveGameNow","MainMenuChoices2"]) (without spaces) to see if that had been fixed and tested to see what happens if pressed enter and it crashed. We need to make sure the system doesnt crash when it's invalid and also keep it from becoming invalid when pasting in various formats. I will test again by pasting it with the spaces (/add_action_group(TpMenu,[ "GotoDivineDomain", "SaveGameNow", "MainMenuChoices2"]))

Interesting! It seems the group is created! But we have a second issue! I will say this is progress!
