07/29/24 21:26:32: [Jay Arnold] i want to talk about how the text chat input box should slide up once it reaches a certain length depending on the max visible lines, also considering if the line count has reached the max line limit. (for example if there was only 1 message in the chat box, i would be able to type 5 more lines before the box moved up compared to if there were 6 messages. but if the limit is 12 then after 3 lines then it should begin to go up. i believe 15 is the max amount of lines that can be seen on the game screen so thats why my math is like that
