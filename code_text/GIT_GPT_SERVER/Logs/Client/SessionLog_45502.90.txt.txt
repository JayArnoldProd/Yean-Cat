It's not working! The names are saved in master.saveboss[i,1]. Some of the names contain spaces and one even a dash! The space and dashes should be removed so Bee-yonce" becomes "Beeyonce1" and "Travis Squawk" becomes "TravisSquawk1" if theres already a "TravisSquawk1" then its "TravisSquawk2" lets make it work this way please!
