can use our systems and over time becomes a documentation for our scripting language. i will include all
of the examples we have created over time so that you can know how our language works.

07/31/24 23:23:22: [Jay Arnold] the most recent thing we added was the target object reference and camera positioning.
with this we are now able to use Target before a dot and then we can reuse the action for any object we
set to target using /set_target( and then running the action. the camera system is smooth
and works similarly to chat_bubble and spawn_boss and spawn_npc in the way that it looks for an
object or point reference before the dot. in the future many more commands will take advantage of this
format and I want to ensure that it is easy to add more and more scripts that handle this way, without
creating more and more cases in the execute_command for each new one. the goal is to have an easily
expandible system that only requires creating a new script and a definition of the script in the client
create event. I understand that for building the system itself and creating new language functions will
involve modifying parts of my code until it is right. but the end goal is a neat system. without breaking
any past functionality along the way.

will create an action_condition that can be executed using /execute_action if the statement is true it
will perform action1 if false then Action2 (a clever way to have if/else)
With this implemented we would be able to have npcs that only give you certain branches if you have
reached a certain level or killed a number of enemies. We could test if the player has enough money to
buy something and create an action group that deducts the money and rewards the item if they have
enough, but tells them sorry if they cant. This is also useful for overall progression conditions. These
should execute just like actions and should work as chat bubble choice actions as well.
