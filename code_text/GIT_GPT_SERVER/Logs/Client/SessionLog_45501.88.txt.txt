//END OF LOG

Essentially instead of having to paste each command one at a time, I would love to be able to paste in multiple lines at once and execute them in order! This is important as in game scripting could get long and complicated and I will be relying on AI to formulate these sequences of commands to create emergent behaviors and story telling. Being able to paste many at once will save me lots of actions on my behalf. In addition to making this possible I also will need to implement the "shift enter" function that will create a new line. Currently pressing enter regardless of shift, will cause the text to be entered. This will allow me to manually type these multiple command text inputs.
