07/18/24 22:11:57: [Jay Arnold] at least i can do that. but lets try and fix the add_action and find
 out why its not saving multiple arguments!    I did a second test after manually changing the actions.txt to the desired result: Hello,chat_bubble,"Hello World!","yeancat"
Level100,level_up,100  and then restarting the game and trying to execute the action! This should be useful information as well.  07/18/24 22:16:16: Loaded action: Hello, Command: chat_bubble, Parameters: [ "Hello World!","yeancat" ]

saving of the action or the adding of it!
