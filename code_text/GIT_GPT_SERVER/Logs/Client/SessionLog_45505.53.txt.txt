Tell me how to proceed so that the listing will work properly for everything:

Perhaps this can be made better now that it's separated? Im not sure where action conditions are stored now. Maybe they need their own list too.

/// @function scr_list_actions()
/// @description Lists all saved actions (excluding action groups) with line breaks
function scr_list_actions() {
    if (ds_map_size(global.actionDetails) == 0) {
        handleDebugMessage("No actions found.", false);
        return;
    }

    var actions = ds_list_create();
    var key = ds_map_find_first(global.actionDetails);

    while (!is_undefined(key)) {
        var encodedData = ds_map_find_value(global.actionDetails, key);
        var decodedData = json_parse(base64_decode(encodedData));
        
        // Only add to the list if it's not an action group
        if (!is_struct(decodedData) || !variable_struct_exists(decodedData, "type") || (decodedData.type != "action_group" && decodedData.type != "action_condition")) {
            ds_list_add(actions, key);
        }
        
        key = ds_map_find_next(global.actionDetails, key);
    }

    if (ds_list_size(actions) == 0) {
        handleDebugMessage("No individual actions found.", false);
        ds_list_destroy(actions);
        return;
    }

    ds_list_sort(actions, true);

    var actionsList = "Actions: ";
    var currentLine = actionsList;
    var maxLineLength = 70; // Maximum characters per line

    for (var i = 0; i < ds_list_size(actions); i++) {
        var action = ds_list_find_value(actions, i) + (i < ds_list_size(actions) - 1 ? ", " : "");

        if (string_length(currentLine) + string_length(action) > maxLineLength) {
            handleDebugMessage(currentLine, false);
            currentLine = action;
        } else {
            currentLine += action;
        }
    }

    if (string_length(currentLine) > 0) {
        handleDebugMessage(currentLine, false);
    }

    ds_list_destroy(actions);
}

Ive added global.actionConditions = ds_map_create(); to my client create event
Ive also added script for load_action_conditions and save_action_conditions! With all 4 separated it should be easier to manage everything, and more optimized if im correct.

Now that choices are triggering action groups (NICE) we need to make sure everything is listing and test the other command sequences that show off conditions for and/or/>=/etc... combined with chat bubbles and so on. We need to make the system work for conditions and action conditions. Action conditions, action groups, and actions should all be able to be triggered with /execute_action( or inside a chat_bubble(.
