07/24/24 10:42:14: [Jay Arnold] Nice! that worked! lets see if it wraps now!

07/24/24 10:43:34: [Jay Arnold] It does wrap but not correctly. There are 4 lines of text, but the box 
only stretched vertically to fit 3 lines. previously, my text would shrink
 after a certain length of text or /n and the max width would increase 
for each new line, to keep the ratio nice. I would rather wider than 
taller.

07/24/24 10:44:37: [Jay Arnold] that text was vertically one line too long, and didnt take advantage of 
the width of the generated chat bubble size, it was about half as wide 
(the text) as it should have been. that would have resulted in fewer 
vertical lines as well.

07/24/24 10:45:36: [Jay Arnold] We need to make sure that the chat text and chat bubble size are 
elegantly linked , it seems the text is correctly shrinking, but there is 
something off. ill provide a screen shot of this text in a chat bubble.
