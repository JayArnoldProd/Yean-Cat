Changing the macro 5 changed the camera position meaning I couldn't see what im typing because the chat box is not drawn to the gui. Macro 5 and 6 were supposed to only tweak the offset of the 3d objects and the client does not have any 3d code in its draw event. Ideally this problem could be solved without me having to tweak offset and you could see what is causing the depth to make our 3d objects so off set! Our camera should always appear centered and will have a slight rotation and positional follow of the yeancat object as we increase the level of 3d from 0 to 1. At 1 it should be everything draws as if it was just 2d. And higher (>0) applies the effect to objects that have the 3d code in their draw, causing the camera to have more movement that shows the depth (subtly)
