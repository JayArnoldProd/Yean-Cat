    "description": "The main bug in my game that needs fixing is that for some reason, typing /add_action(Lvl100,level_up,[100]) works and creates a reusable action named,Lvl100. Typing /execute_action(Lvl100) will level up the player 100 times. The issue is when I try to create an action with 2 or more arguments, something goes wrong. For example: /add_action(HelloWorld,chat_bubble,[Hello World!,yeancat]) does not work. It says that it created an action, but when I try to execute the action, it throws an error (see client logs). I have reason to believe the saving of the actions is where this goes wrong. (scr_add_action)",
